            <p class="me2">My name is Victorine Amani and I am a computer programming student of AkiraChix. I have been working on a poetry app that will help youths in my country and beyond get a platform to showcase their talents, a safe space to just be themselves
                and express themselves through all forms of poetry. A place to meet and mingle with like minds. This is the first web app I have designed and it is still a working progress. I would like to find myself working for a medium to large technical
                company as I work towards having my own startup. As the world progresses my skills will help me keep up with the trends and and be invaluable.

        <p class="me2">I am a girl who loves art especially poetry and the theatre. I enjoy watching movies in my free time or performing some of my personal pieces. I love fun and laughter, but I also love my personal space and I take alot of me times just to reinvent
            myself. I would love to travel all over the world and learn different cultures, how they have advanced in technology and most definitetly their food. I love watching sponge bob.

        <p class="me2">I believe that our destinies are a blank page and as you go along, as you experience new things you map out how you want your life to turn out. Sometimes we have to go back and change a few things, experinces in our lives will determine what to
            be changed and where. You have the freedom of becoming who you want to be and just as there are a endless words of all langugaes so are your options just as limitless.
